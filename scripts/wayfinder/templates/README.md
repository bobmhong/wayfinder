# Wayfinder templates

This directory contains templates for generating provisions you'll need in your Wayfinder voyages. Code is generated for secrets, pipelines, & general configurations needed prior to installing your voyage in a cluster.

Each template uses Go Templating and is similar to Helm Templates, but is rendered with the [gomplate](https://docs.gomplate.ca/) CLI.
